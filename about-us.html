							<p>We are a group of highly motivated computer programmers who value equality and quality. In our eyes everyone
								has must have the right to have access to the toolsa and equipments that they need to make their dreams come to
								reality.
								We try to remove barriers and limitations of accessing to the goods and services by renting the items with much
								lower price to save money and effort for everyone.</p>
							<br><br>
							<h4 class="text-center">Rent'emAll Goals/Objectives</h4>
							<p>Our web application will empower the items owners to not only save money on storage area but also earn money
								by renting out his/her not-immediately needed items and belongings for a specified period under a negotiable
								contract.
								In this case, the borrower also spends much less for being able to use needed item while the borrower also does
								not worry about maintaining and storing that item after he/she has finished using it. The person simply ships
								it back to the item owner at the end of the contract period. Customer will be able to purchase insurance for
								items based on their interests to be protected in case of unexpected damage to the item.
								Our customers save much more money on using similar items in comparison with brand new buyers who pay high
								prices plus tax.</p>
							<p>Our customers save environment by decreasing waste production and increasing reusability of
								items.<br />
								&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong style="padding: 25px; color: #323232; font-size: 1.3rem;">>Rent - Reuse - Return</strong></p>
							<p>Our lenders can earn money by renting out their items instead of paying money for storage area.</p>
